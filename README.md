Hi, I'm octavio mathias. I'm responsible for this account.

I'm interesting in data science, data analytics and development of useful tools for Engineering.

Currently I'm learning more topics about data science and artificial inteligence so I can apply those concepts in the development of softwares and 
Hardwares, eventually.

I'm looking forward to collaborate in projects with this area. Whenever we have to take decisions based on data and matematical modelling, I'm on and willing to help.
